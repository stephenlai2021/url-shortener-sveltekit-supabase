# URL Shortener App

This url shortener application is a production ready app, it is a fullstack app powered by Sveltekit and Supabase. It has a robust authentication system, each page / api route is fully protected. It has a good-looking user interface and fully functional CRUD backend operations. Once user sign in the page redirects to dashboard where we can enter original url in the input box to get the shortened url, it is customized to the authenticated user so we won't be able to see the data that does not belong to us.
